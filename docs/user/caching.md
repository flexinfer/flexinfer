# Caching

FlexInfer supports caching at two layers:

- **Artifact caching**: model weights are present locally (disk or RAM)
- **Runtime warmup**: backend is already running and ready to serve

## v1alpha2 cache strategies

`Model.spec.cache.strategy`:

- `Memory`: fastest reloads; uses RAM (best for homelabs)
- `SharedPVC`: persistent storage shared across nodes (slower than RAM, but durable)
- `None`: always download/prepare on demand (slowest)

If `spec.cache` is omitted, FlexInfer infers a strategy based on GPU sharing.

## v1alpha1 `ModelCache`

`ModelCache` lets you pre-download (and optionally pre-warm) a model artifact.

Common pattern:

- Create a `ModelCache` (SharedPVC or Memory)
- Reference it from `ModelDeployment.spec.modelCacheRef`

Examples:

- `services/flexinfer/examples/ram-cached-models.yaml`
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (MLC-LLM caching example)

## Troubleshooting cache issues

- Inspect `ModelCache` status:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n flexinfer-system get modelcache -o wide
  kubectl -n flexinfer-system describe modelcache <name>
  ```
- Check downloader logs (v1alpha1):
  ```bash
  kubectl -n flexinfer-system logs -l job-name=<cache-name>-downloader
  ```
