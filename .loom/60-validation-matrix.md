# gfx1100 Runtime Promotion Validation Matrix

This is the canonical canary and runtime-promotion evidence table for gfx1100
model/runtime work. It connects planning specs, roadmap items, build artifacts,
runtime canaries, observed failure modes, and promotion decisions so a reviewer
can audit a promotion without reading chat history.

Scope:

- Primary GPU class: AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX / ROCm `gfx1100`.
- Primary roadmap/spec link: SD-3 in
  `docs/planning/spec-driven-delivery.md` and
  `docs/planning/next-roadmap.md`.
- Existing Gemma4 and Qwen evidence remains in this file; rows may stay `TBD`
  until the artifact reaches a real validation layer.

## Validation Contract

Every runtime or canary row must capture these audit fields before it can be
promoted:

| Field | Required value |
|---|---|
| `artifact` | ModelCache name, model family, PVC path, or artifact label being evaluated. |
| `context_length` | Runtime `maxModelLen`, benchmark context, or explicit `n/a` with reason. |
| `gpu_class` | Hardware class such as `gfx1100/7900xtx`, `gfx906/radeonvii`, or `sm_52/maxwell`. |
| `runtime_image` | Image digest, immutable OCI ref, or temporary tag plus follow-up to pin digest. |
| `oci_ref` | Published model OCI ref or PVC/local artifact ref when OCI is not used. |
| `observed_failure_mode` | `none` for a clean canary, or the concrete scheduler/runtime/cache failure. |
| `spec_roadmap_link` | Spec, roadmap item, issue, MR, or commit proving why the row exists. |
| `promotion_decision` | `promote`, `conditional`, `block`, `fail`, `skip`, or `pending`. |

Promotion rules:

- `promote`: metadata validation passes, runtime canary is coherent, the model
  reaches Ready, and the runtime image or model artifact is pinned by digest or
  immutable OCI ref.
- `conditional`: the canary serves successfully but has a documented warning,
  temporary tag, manual family override, or follow-up that does not block the
  current operator outcome.
- `block`: evidence is incomplete or a known prerequisite is missing.
- `fail`: the attempted runtime cannot satisfy the target context or returns
  incoherent/error responses.
- `skip`: intentionally not a target for this GPU class or slice.
- `pending`: no runtime evidence has been captured yet.

## Validation Layers

The codebase exposes two separate validation surfaces. Keep them separate in
the row notes:

1. **Artifact metadata validator**: `build/scripts/validate_quantized_artifact.py`
   through `flexinfer quantize validate-artifact`. Offline, no GPU required.
   Checks layout, shapes, module coverage, optional generation repetition probe,
   and emits structured `checks` JSON. It does not measure cosine or perplexity.
2. **Dense-module cosine gate**: quantize-time gate when `denseModulePolicy:
   validate` and `denseModuleCosineThreshold` are set on a `ModelCache`.
   Requires re-quantization; it does not run against already-published artifacts.
3. **Runtime canary**: cluster deployment or direct runtime smoke that proves
   the target artifact/image reaches Ready and serves coherent output at the
   target context length.

## Artifact Layout Notes

- `--layout hf-native`: standard HF safetensors, no quantization metadata
  (source or abliteration artifact).
- `--layout vllm-gptq`: GPTQ with vLLM-style
  `modules_in_block_to_quantize` in `config.json`.
- `--layout compressed-tensors`: RedHatAI / compressed-tensors pack; currently
  about 2 tok/s on gfx1100, avoid for promotion unless a slice specifically
  targets that layout.

## Raw Evidence Archive

Large JSON outputs and smoke transcripts go under
`.loom/local/validation/<family>/<timestamp>/`. Summaries only belong in this
tracked file. Each archive should include the exact command, artifact path,
runtime image digest or OCI ref when available, and smoke response transcript.

### 2026-04-18 gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq findings (Slice A1-lite)

- Active serving artifact:
  `/models/gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq/gptq-w4-g128-attnfp16-clean` (confirmed from
  vLLM cmdline `--model ...` on pod
  `gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq-87c45466d-wpkg6`).
- Serving args: `--quantization gptq --attention-backend TRITON_ATTN
  --enforce-eager --max-num-seqs 1 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.95
  --max-model-len 8192`.
- Clean variant: 30 layers x 2 MoE module families quantized
  (`moe.down_proj`, `moe.gate_up_proj`); 30
  `attention-fp16-layer-NN.safetensors` shards hold the FP16 attention weights
  alongside 4 `model-X-of-00004.safetensors` base shards; total 777 tensors,
  34 shard files.
- Hybrid-v10 variant (on-PVC but not served): fully quantized layout (MoE +
  MLP + attention q/k/v/o) with `self_attn.v_proj` only present on 25/30 layers.
  This is consistent with `attention_k_eq_v: true` in the config, but it must be
  confirmed before promoting this variant.
- Validator follow-ups:
  1. Family auto-detection gap: `detected_family: null` for both variants.
     `FAMILY_PROFILES` in `build/scripts/validate_quantized_artifact.py`
     matches tensor-name hints; add a `model_type: gemma4_text` or architecture
     signal so the CLI works without a forced `--family` flag.
  2. Flat `modules_in_block_to_quantize` warning is always-on for vLLM-serving
     artifacts. Either silence it for that layout or make it informational-only.
- No re-quant or cosine gate ran. `denseModulePolicy: validate` remains
  commented out in `deploy/modelcaches/gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq.yaml`.

Raw outputs:
`.loom/local/validation/gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq/20260418-085841/{clean.json,clean.txt,hybrid-v10.json}`
(gitignored).

### 2026-05-05 qwen36-27b-gptq smoke findings

- Artifact pipeline completed: ModelCache `qwen36-27b-gptq-gfx1100`
  abliterated 3 layers in `1h53m20s`, quantized GPTQ `W4_G128` in `1h19m30s`,
  and published
  `registry.harbor.lan/flexinfer/qwen36-27b:gptq-w4-g128-gfx1100@sha256:fe3a6bea0cd2cdf254a5db6194e01402f1f7f93c4b86d8c717695470fdd3849d`.
- Replacement Model `qwen36-27b-gptq` activated on `cblevins-5930k`. Initial
  proxy activation returned 503 because `LastActiveTime` status updates hit a
  conflict after scale-up had already started.
- Cold activation reached the pod quickly, but kubelet spent `12m33s` pulling
  the 17.6GB ROCm vLLM image. Cache flash from hostPath to `/dev/shm` took
  about 9 seconds.
- Runtime config `kvCacheDtype: fp8_e4m3` failed during vLLM KV warm-up:
  Triton reported `type fp8e4nv not supported in this architecture`. Live
  canary with `kvCacheDtype: auto`, `calculateKvScales: false`, and
  `maxNumSeqs: 2` reached Ready.
- `gptq_marlin` was tested as a coherence fix but vLLM rejected it because the
  model config declares quantization method `gptq`.
- Direct FlexInfer proxy and direct service requests returned HTTP 200, but
  output was incoherent: exact-answer prompts produced repeated exclamation
  marks and multilingual junk. Treat this as a model artifact/runtime blocker,
  not a routing success.
- Follow-up direct safetensor check on `cblevins-5930k` mounted
  `qwen36-27b-gptq-gfx1100` and dequantized representative GPTQ attention
  tensors against the post-abliteration FP16 parent. Layers 11 and 15
  `q/k/v/o` had no NaNs/Infs, sane weight stats, cosine about `0.99`, and
  relative L2 about `0.13-0.16`, so the cache is not broadly corrupt.
- Next runtime fix: Qwen3.5-patched vLLM must use the ROCm GPTQ reference
  fallback already proven necessary for Gemma4. The Qwen patch stack now adds a
  `GPTQLinearMethod.apply` ROCm/4-bit slow path so the next rebuilt runtime can
  test coherence without the fused `gptq_gemm` kernel.

### 2026-05-06 qwen36-27b-gptq quality recheck

- Runtime image was quiet and digest-pinned:
  `registry.harbor.lan/flexinfer/vllm@sha256:cb6d92c956ee150b4b8210e625586140e1b5da4c204caa422b1965e953de78e8`.
- Greedy chat smoke through `flexinfer-proxy`:
  `{"model":"qwen36-27b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Answer with exactly one word: blue"}],"max_tokens":24,"temperature":0,"top_p":1}`
  returned HTTP 200 with `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`.
- Direct `/v1/completions` smoke against `qwen36-27b-gptq:8000` for prompt
  `The color of the sky is` returned `!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!` with identical
  top-logprobs for punctuation tokens (`!`, `"`, `#`, `$`, `%`) at each
  generated position (`-12.422473907470703`), indicating a flat/collapsed
  logits distribution rather than a sampling or chat-template problem.
- Pod logs confirmed the quiet patch applied the ROCm GPTQ reference fallback,
  naive FLA kernels, RMSNorm native path, and direct `gdn_attention_core`
  bypass, so the remaining blocker is deeper artifact/runtime math or
  quantized-weight interpretation.
- Serving posture: keep `qwen36-27b-gptq` as a direct canary only. Do not expose
  replacement labels such as `qwen3-coder` or `qwen3-30b-a3b` until a coherent
  deterministic smoke passes.

### 2026-04-26 gemma4 26B/31B execution findings

- Live Flux truth before hot validation: `flexinfer-system` and
  `flexinfer-models` were Ready at
  `master@sha1:50cf1d977d502357df1c5c6b998c05b1dc05f429`; !193 and !194 were
  already merged.
- `gemma4-31b-gptq` was Ready/Active with `minReplicas: 1`, `priority: 250`,
  `gpu.count: 2`, `warmPolicy: primary`, and `maxModelLen: 2048`. The direct
  smoke through a port-forward returned HTTP 200 with answer `4` in 0.158s.
- After the long-canary hot test, 31B was restored to Ready/Running and a second
  direct smoke returned HTTP 200 with answer `4` in 0.304s.
- `gemma4-26b-a4b-gptq-long` has the safe dGPU selector, cache Ready,
  `minReplicas: 0`, and `maxModelLen: 32768`, but the fp16-KV long-context
  canary failed at engine initialization. vLLM loaded the weights successfully
  (`17.74 GiB`, `56.69s`) but reported only `1.87 GiB` available for KV while
  `32768` tokens required `6.88 GiB`; the logged estimated maximum model length
  was `8896`. This blocks both 16K and 32K promotion on the current
  hybrid/fp16-KV lane.
- The 26B dense-validated cache did not reach the cosine gate. Its latest retry
  reached only harmful prompt `80/128` before the 4h abliteration deadline; the
  checkpoint remained in `stage: harmful_activations`. Because `abliterate.py`
  resumes only completed activation payloads, each retry restarts the partial
  harmful pass. The manifest now raises abliteration and quantization deadlines
  to 24h so the next Flux-managed rebuild can reach dense cosine validation.
- TurboQuant primitive sharing is implemented behind `TQ4_SHARE_PRIMITIVES=1`
  and the patcher was verified idempotent against upstream `turboquant-vllm`
  commit `9d19b87cef462cf0abd5643f6d052ac5a3bc99b6`. Runtime canaries still
  require a rebuilt image carrying the patched profile.
